# Alibaba_Product_WebScraper_using_BeautifulSoup
This Python script scrapes product listings from Alibaba's website and stores the data in a CSV file. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML content. The scraped data is then saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
